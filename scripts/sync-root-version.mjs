/**
 * Sync the monorepo root package version to the release train.
 *
 * The root `getcito` package is not a workspace member, so `changeset version`
 * never bumps it and it drifts behind the published packages. Every workspace
 * package shares a single version (changesets `fixed: [["**"]]`), so we copy
 * that version onto the root purely as a visual marker of the current release.
 * Runs automatically as part of `pnpm version-packages`.
 *
 * Idempotent: only rewrites the root manifest when the version differs, and
 * touches only the version string so the rest of the file is left untouched.
